# id-wiki-osu

> RIP June 2017 - June 2017; A tool created to pass some time. Immediately died after completion.

## Usage

1. Download the lastest `id-osu` [release](https://github.com/MegaApplePi/id-osu/releases)
2. Extract
3. Open `id-osu.exe`
4. Type in the osu!username then press `Enter`.
5. Depending if the osu!username is a valid name or not, one of three dialogs will appear:
   - `osu!user id copied to clipboard!`
     - this means the name is valid and the id has been copied for you
   - `Not a valid osu!username!`
     - the name you entered is too short or too long
     - or the username entered does not exist
   - `Cannot get osu!user id!`
     - various reasons but likely your internet connection is broke
